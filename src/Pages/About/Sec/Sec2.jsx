                    <p><em>When basics go wrong...</em></p>
                    <br />
                    <p>A perfect building can't be made when basics are wrong...every student is individual and the way of learning needs a different approach, one approach is not working for all forty students in a classroom.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In Indian schools, the average student-teacher ratio is 40:1, hence it is very difficult for teachers to personalize learning for each student. Students' strength is big in numbers and teachers mostly follow- "read, show and ask" method, hence mostly students remain blank and do not participate actively in this learning process. They apply rote learning<span>and gain only theoretical knowledge to get some marks in the exam, which leads to a weak foundation of subjects.</span></p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Parents ask for tuitions after school to fill this gap, here most of the tutors are not expert of subject, they are giving 2-3 hours just to earn some extra bucks with their ongoing study. These tutors taking classes of 6-7 students of different grades simultaneously and helping them to complete their homework given by the school in all subjects, the problem remains the same.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>As being a tech educator we have seen this problem and made Tuitionpad to reshape the "tuitions" by providing real personalized learning by selected (selected teachers through our selection process- 1 out of 50), verified expert teachers who are passionate, having previous experience with proven records, having capability to make a strong foundation with their teaching skills.</p>
